= The Internals of Apache Beam Online Book

The project contains the sources of https://books.japila.pl/apache-beam-internals[The Internals of Apache Beam] online book.

== Toolz

The project uses the following toolz:

* https://antora.org/[Antora] which is touted as _The Static Site Generator for Tech Writers_.

* http://asciidoc.org/[Asciidoc] (with some https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor])

* https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages[GitHub Pages]

* https://atom.io/[Atom editor] with https://github.com/asciidoctor/atom-asciidoc-preview[Asciidoc preview] plugin

* https://www.docker.com/[Docker] to https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/antora-container/#run-the-antora-image[run the Antora image]

It's all to make things harder..._ekhm_...reach higher levels of writing zen.

== Generating Book

In order to generate the book, use the commands as described in https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/antora-container/[Run Antora in a Container].

Below are the steps I'm taking to deploy a new version of the site.

```
$ docker run -u $UID --privileged -v `pwd`:/antora --rm -t antora/antora antora-playbook.yml

// alternatively and recommended
$ docker run --entrypoint ash --privileged -v `pwd`:/antora --rm -it antora/antora

// Inside the container
/antora # antora version
2.3.1

/antora # antora local-antora-playbook.yml

// On your local computer (outside the container)
$ open .out/local/index.html
```

**IMPORTANT**: If your Antora build does not seem to work properly, use `docker run ... --pull`. This resets your cache.

== Not Sphinx?! Why?
