= Read

`Read` gives utilities to read from a <<from-BoundedSource, bounded>> and <<from-UnboundedSource, unbounded>> sources (by creating root xref:PTransform.adoc[]s).

== [[from-BoundedSource]] Reading From Bounded Source -- from Utility

[source,java]
----
<T> Bounded<T> from(
  BoundedSource<T> source)
----

from static method creates a <<Bounded, Read.Bounded>> root PTransform for the given xref:BoundedSource.adoc[].

== [[from-UnboundedSource]] Reading From Unbounded Source -- from Utility

[source,java]
----
<T> Unbounded<T> from(
  UnboundedSource<T, ?> source)
----

from static method creates a <<Unbounded, Read.Unbounded>> root PTransform for the given xref:UnboundedSource.adoc[].

== [[Bounded]] Bounded Root PTransform

`Bounded<T>` is a xref:PTransform.adoc#root[root PTransform] (`PTransform<PBegin, PCollection<T>>`).

== [[Unbounded]] Unbounded Root PTransform

`Unbounded<T>` is a xref:PTransform.adoc#root[root PTransform] (`PTransform<PBegin, PCollection<T>>`).
