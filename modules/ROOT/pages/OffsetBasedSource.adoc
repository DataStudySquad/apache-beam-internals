OffsetBasedSource takes the following to be created:

* [[startOffset]] Starting Offset
* [[endOffset]] End Offset
* [[minBundleSize]] Minimum Bundle Size

OffsetBasedSource is an abstract class and cannot be created directly. It is created indirectly for the <<implementations, concrete OffsetBasedSources>>.
