= Introduction

https://beam.apache.org/[Apache Beam] describes itself as follows:

> **Apache Beam** is an open source unified programming model to define and execute data processing pipelines, including ETL, batch and stream (continuous) processing. See https://beam.apache.org

The aim of this book is to dissect the intro and shed more light on the internals.

From the https://github.com/apache/beam#the-beam-model[official documentation]:

The key concepts in the Beam programming model are:

* `PCollection`: represents a collection of data, which could be bounded or unbounded in size.
* `PTransform`: represents a computation that transforms input PCollections into output PCollections.
* `Pipeline`: manages a directed acyclic graph of PTransforms and PCollections that is ready for execution.
* `PipelineRunner`: specifies where and how the pipeline should execute.
