= Metrics

`Metrics` is used for reporting properties of a pipeline being executed.

Metrics are `Counters`, `Distributions`, `Gauges` and can be created using `Metrics.counter`, `Metrics.distribution` and `Metrics.gauge` static methods, respectively.

A Metric is associated with a namespace and has a name.

```plaintext
import org.apache.beam.sdk.metrics.Metrics
// using String to make the sample "doable" without creating a proper class
val counter = Metrics.counter(classOf[String], "my-counter")

scala> println(counter.getName)
java.lang.String:my-counter

scala> counter.inc
[run-main-0] WARN org.apache.beam.sdk.metrics.MetricsEnvironment - Reporting metrics are not supported in the current execution environment.

import org.apache.beam.sdk.metrics.MetricsEnvironment
MetricsEnvironment.setMetricsSupported(true)
```

`MetricResults` (available using `PipelineResults.metrics`) allow for querying metrics.
