A directed acyclic graph of PTransforms and PCollections is a xref::Pipeline.adoc[].

== Root PTransform

*Root PTransform* (*source PTransform*) is a `PTransform<PBegin, PCollection<...>>` that takes no input (conventionally marked as `PBegin` input type), e.g. `TextIO.Read` or `Create`.

== Outputting PTransform

*Outputting PTransform* (*sink PTransform*) is a `PTransform<PCollection<...>, PDone>` that has no output (conventionally marked as `PDone` output type), e.g. `TextIO.Write`.
