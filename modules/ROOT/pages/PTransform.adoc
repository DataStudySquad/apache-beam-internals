A directed acyclic graph of PTransforms and PCollections is a xref::Pipeline.adoc[].

== [[source]] Source PTransform

*Source PTransform* (_Root PTransform_) is a `PTransform<PBegin, PCollection<...>>` that takes no input (conventionally marked as `PBegin` input type), e.g. xref:TextIO.adoc#read[TextIO.Read] or `Create`.

== [[sink]] Sink PTransform

*Sink PTransform* (_Output PTransform_) is a `PTransform<PCollection<...>, PDone>` that has no output (conventionally marked as `PDone` output type), e.g. `TextIO.Write`.
