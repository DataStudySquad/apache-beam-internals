Available root PTransforms: xref:TextIO.adoc#read[TextIO.Read], xref:AvroIO.adoc#read[AvroIO.Read], xref:Create.adoc[].

== [[sink]] Sink PTransform

*Sink PTransform* (_Output PTransform_) is a `PTransform<PCollection<...>, PDone>` that has no output (conventionally marked as `PDone` output type), e.g. `TextIO.Write`.
